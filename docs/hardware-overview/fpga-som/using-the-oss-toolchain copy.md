# Using the open-source toolchain (OSS)
You can use the open-source toolchain to synthesize custom bitstreams for the C0-microSD. The open-source toolchain includes [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys), [NextPnR](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr/tree/master) and [Icestorm](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm). You can install the toolchain by compiling it for your environment, or find pre-compiled binaries [here](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build).

## PCF file reference
In the Place and Route stage of the workflow, `NextPnR` can use a `.pcf` file to describe physical constraints. You can find more information in the [NextPnR documentation](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr/blob/master/docs/ice40.md).

Following is an example `.pcf` pinout configuration file for the C0-microSD.

```

## Generating and flashing your custom bitstream
You can generate the final bitstream configuration for the C0-microSD using the `icepack` tool, which is part of the `Icestorm` toolkit. You can find details on how to flash your custom bitstream [here](/guides/flash-data-to-c0-microsd.html).
