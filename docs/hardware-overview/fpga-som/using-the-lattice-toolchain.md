# Using the proprietary toolchain
Lattice Semiconductor provides a free license for Lattice Radiant, their latest CAD suite that supports the iCE40 FPGA. You can find more details in the official Lattice Radiant [product page](https://www.latticesemi.com/latticeradiant).

## PDC file reference
Similar to the OSS toolchain, Lattice Radiant uses post-synthesis constraint files to map the design's pinout to the physical chip. Following is an example `.pdc` pinout configuration file for the C0-microSD. You can create a new post-synthesis constraint file in your project by navigating to `File -> New -> File`, and selecting `Post-Synthesis Constraint Files` in the pop-up window.

## Generating and flashing your custom bitstream
To generate the correct format of bitstream for your C0-microSD, select and edit your active strategy, navigate to the `Bitstream` section, and make sure that the `Output Format` option is set to `Bit File (Binary)`. You can find details on how to flash your custom bitstream [here](/guides/flash-data-to-c0-microsd.html).
